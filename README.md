# Linear-Search
Linear Search is the simplest searching technique used to find an element in a list. It checks each element one by one from the beginning until the target element is found or the list ends. It works on both sorted and unsorted arrays. If a match is found, the index is returned; otherwise, the algorithm reports that the element is not present.
